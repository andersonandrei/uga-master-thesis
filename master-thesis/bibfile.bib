abstract = "An efficient resource allocation is a fundamental requirement in high performance computing (HPC) systems. Many projects are dedicated to large-scale distributed computing systems that have designed and developed resource allocation mechanisms with a variety of architectures and services. In our study, through analysis, a comprehensive survey for describing resource allocation in various HPCs is reported. The aim of the work is to aggregate under a joint framework, the existing solutions for HPC to provide a thorough analysis and characteristics of the resource management and allocation strategies. Resource allocation mechanisms and strategies play a vital role towards the performance improvement of all the HPCs classifications. Therefore, a comprehensive discussion of widely used resource allocation strategies deployed in HPC environment is required, which is one of the motivations of this survey. Moreover, we have classified the HPC systems into three broad categories, namely: (a) cluster, (b) grid, and (c) cloud systems and define the characteristics of each class by extracting sets of common attributes. All of the aforementioned systems are cataloged into pure software and hybrid/hardware solutions. The system classification is used to identify approaches followed by the implementation of existing resource allocation strategies that are widely presented in the literature."

abstract="Grid is a distributed high performance computing paradigm that offers various types of resources (like computing, storage, communication) to resource-intensive user tasks. These tasks are scheduled to allocate available Grid resources efficiently to achieve high system throughput and to satisfy user requirements. The task scheduling problem has become more complex with the ever increasing size of Grid systems. Even though selecting an efficient resource allocation strategy for a particular task helps in obtaining a desired level of service, researchers still face difficulties in choosing a suitable technique from a plethora of existing methods in literature. In this paper, we explore and discuss existing resource allocation mechanisms for resource allocation problems employed in Grid systems. The work comprehensively surveys Gird resource allocation mechanisms for different architectures (centralized, distributed, static or dynamic). The paper also compares these resource allocation mechanisms based on their common features such as time complexity, searching mechanism, allocation strategy, optimality, operational environment and objective function they adopt for solving computing- and data-intensive applications. The comprehensive analysis of cutting-edge research in the Grid domain presented in this work provides readers with an understanding of essential concepts of resource allocation mechanisms in Grid systems and helps them identify important and outstanding issues for further investigation. It also helps readers to choose the most appropriate mechanism for a given system/application.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things needs for computing power and storage are expected to remain on the rise in the next decade. Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures."

abstract="A workload characteristic on a parallel computer depends on an administration policy or a user community for the computer system. An administrator of a parallel computer system needs to select an appropriate scheduling algorithm that schedules multiple jobs on the computer system efficiently. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to investigate mechanisms how job size characteristics affect job scheduling performance. For this goal, this paper evaluates the performance of job scheduling algorithms under various workload models, each of which has a certain characteristic related to the number of processors requested by a job, and analyzes the mechanism for job size characteristics that affect job scheduling performance significantly in the evaluation. The results showed that: (1) most scheduling algorithms classified into the first-fit scheduling showed best performance and were not affected by job size characteristics, (2) certain job size characteristics affected performance of priority scheduling significantly. The analysis of the results showed that the LJF algorithm, which dispatched the largest job first, would perfectly pack jobs to idle processors at high load, where all jobs requested powerof- two processors and the number of processors on a parallel computer was power-of-two.",

abstract="The arrival process of jobs submitted to a parallel system is bursty, leading to fluctuations in the load at many time scales. In particular, rare events of extreme load may occur. Such events lead to an increase in the standard deviation of performance metrics, and thus delay the convergence of simulations used to evaluate the scheduling. Different performance metrics have been proposed in an effort to reduce this variability, and indeed display different rates of convergence. However, there is no single metric that outperforms the others under all conditions. Rather, the convergence of different metrics depends on the system being studied.",

abstract = "Performance and energy are critical aspects in high performance computing (HPC) data centers. Highly parallel HPC applications that require multiple nodes usually run for long durations in the range of minutes, hours or days. As the threads of parallel applications communicate with each other intensively, the communication cost of these applications has a significant impact on data center performance. Energy consumption has also become a first-order constraint of HPC data centers. Nearly half of the energy in the computing clusters today is consumed by the cooling infrastructure. Existing job allocation policies either target improving the system performance or reducing the cooling energy cost of the server nodes. How to optimize the system performance while minimizing the cooling energy consumption is still an open question. This paper proposes a job allocation methodology aimed at jointly reducing the communication cost and the cooling energy of HPC data centers. In order to evaluate and validate our optimization algorithm, we implement our joint job allocation methodology in the structural simulation toolkit (SST) – a simulation framework for large-scale data centers. We evaluate our joint optimization algorithm using traces extracted from real-world workloads. Experimental results show that, in comparison to performance-aware job allocation algorithms, our algorithm achieves comparable running times and reduces the cooling power by up to 42.21% across all the jobs."
